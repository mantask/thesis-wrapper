# Summary

The web contains semi-structured information in HTML. To extract structured data from a web page, which gets constant user interface updates, a non-breaking method is required. Building a robust and fast record-level wrapper from a single annotated web page is the subject of this project. Current state of the art methods include *mining data regions* to recognize template generated areas on page, *probabilistic wrapper induction* to extract data from a single data region in a robust way, and *partial tree alignment* to repeatedly extract data from multiple regions. In this thesis, we combine these three ideas into a new method and design a system for robust data extraction. Experimental results using a large number of web pages from multiple domains show that the proposed approach works with a high precision and within reasonable execution time on commodity hardware.
